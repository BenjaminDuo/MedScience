## 2. Adaptation Guidelines & Boundaries

1. **Licensing Compliance:** Attribution and original copyright notices are preserved. Copied or derived code is clearly segregated from MedScience-original product code.
2. **Clean Boundary:** The completed MedScience frontend shell (Milestone 1) is never coupled to upstream internal implementation details; integration occurs via typed event streams.
3. **Reproducibility:** Upstream adaptations prioritize deterministic outputs, explicit provenance, and auditable scientific evidence trails.
