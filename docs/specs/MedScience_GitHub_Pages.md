# MedScience GitHub Pages — Landing Page Specification

## 0. Task

Build the official **MedScience GitHub Pages landing page** for:

`https://github.com/BenjaminDuo/MedScience`

This is **not** a generic AI SaaS marketing page.

The desired result is a serious, documentation-first **AI4S / scientific framework homepage**, inspired by the information architecture and clean presentation of the OmicVerse documentation homepage:

`https://omicverse.github.io/omicverse-pages/index.html`

Do not copy OmicVerse branding, source code, text, or assets. Adapt its **framework/documentation portal structure** to MedScience.

Use the supplied visual reference image as the primary visual direction:

`a_full_page_website_screenshot_landing_page_mock.png`

---

## 1. Product Positioning

MedScience is:

> **MedScience — AI for Scientific Discovery**

The current repository describes MedScience as an evidence-traceable scientific/biomedical research Agent, with emphasis on molecular biology, clinical evidence, medical multimodal research, scientific tools, reproducibility, and agent orchestration.

The current README describes capabilities including:

- evidence-first validation
- DeepSeek Harness sub-agent tree
- explicit planning and task tracking
- clinical data privacy gate
- multimodal text/image reasoning
- dynamic autonomous ReAct research loop
- OS-level sandboxing
- critique and citation verification
- bidirectional MCP interoperability

Represent only capabilities that are actually supported by the current repository. Do not invent features, benchmarks, statistics, papers, integrations, or usage numbers.

---

# 2. Design Direction

The default visual style should be:

- documentation-first
- academic
- scientific
- clean
- bright
- spacious
- technical
- trustworthy
- modern AI4S

Default theme: **Light**.

Use:

- white / near-white background
- light blue-gray borders
- blue primary accent
- cyan secondary accent
- restrained purple scientific accents
- restrained green for verified/success states
- dark navy text

Avoid:

- black futuristic SaaS aesthetic
- excessive neon
- excessive glow
- huge marketing slogans
- crypto/Web3 styling
- generic AI startup visuals
- giant hero with little useful information

The site should feel like:

> **a serious open-source scientific framework that happens to have a powerful AI Agent**

rather than a commercial chatbot landing page.

---

# 3. Information Architecture

Use a documentation-style left sidebar on desktop.

Suggested navigation:

```text
MedScience
AI for Scientific Discovery

Home

Documentation
Installation
Quick Start
User Guide

API Reference
Examples

CLI Agent
Architecture
Agent Skills
Use Cases

Contributing
Changelog

----------------
GitHub
Discord
Paper / Citation

Light / Dark
```

Only link to pages that actually exist. If a page does not exist, either create a sensible page/placeholder or omit the link. Never leave broken navigation.

On mobile, collapse the sidebar into a hamburger menu.

---

# 4. Header

Keep the top header compact.

Right side:

```text
GitHub Star
Get Started
```

Optional search.

The sidebar remains the primary navigation.

---

# 5. Hero

Do NOT make the hero an oversized marketing banner.

Use a documentation-style hero.

### Left

```text
MedScience

AI for Scientific Discovery
```

Description:

```text
An open-source AI agent framework for scientific research.

Explore literature, analyze scientific data, run computational workflows,
and build reproducible research with autonomous agents.
```

Primary:

```text
Quick Start →
```

Secondary:

```text
GitHub Repo
```

### Right

Use the existing MedScience logo / scientific atomic-J visual where possible.

Prefer existing repository assets rather than generating an unrelated new logo.

A subtle scientific composition can include:

- molecular structure
- data panel
- literature panel
- agent activity
- research artifact

Keep it restrained.

---

# 6. Capability Strip

Immediately below the hero, create four compact columns:

### AI-Powered Agents
Specialized agents collaborate on complex research tasks.

### Scientific Tools
Literature, molecular, biological, data-analysis and computational tools.

### Reproducible Research
Evidence, citations, provenance, artifacts and reproducible execution.

### Open Source
Built for researchers and developers.

Use compact scientific icons.

---

# 7. Architecture

Create a major `Architecture` section.

Headline:

```text
Architecture
```

Subheading:

```text
MedScience is built as a modular scientific Agent runtime.
```

Show a clean horizontal architecture diagram:

```text
User Interface
      ↓
MedScience Core
      ↓
Agent Harness
      ↓
Scientific Tools & Skills
      ↓
Results & Artifacts
```

For the future multi-harness direction, show:

```text
DeepSeek Harness
Pi
Codex Harness
```

But **never claim Pi or Codex are integrated if they are not actually integrated in the repository**.

Use status labels such as:

```text
Integrated
Experimental
Planned
```

based on actual repository state.

---

# 8. Architecture Cards

Below the architecture diagram, use three cards.

## Agent Harnesses

Explain the modular harness concept.

Show:

- DeepSeek Harness
- Pi
- Codex Harness

Status must reflect reality.

## Key Capabilities

Use repository-backed capabilities such as:

- literature search
- scientific data retrieval
- molecular / biological analysis
- Python execution
- data analysis
- visualization
- evidence tracking
- citation verification
- critique
- reproducibility
- MCP interoperability

Only include capabilities verified in the repository.

## Use Cases

Prefer scientific examples:

- Literature review
- Drug discovery
- Molecular analysis
- Single-cell / multi-omics
- Clinical evidence research
- Medical multimodal analysis
- Scientific data analysis
- Scientific writing

Do not present a use case as production-ready unless the repository supports it.

---

# 9. Scientific Research Workflow

Create a clean explanatory section:

```text
Ask
  →
Plan
  →
Search
  →
Retrieve Evidence
  →
Analyze
  →
Execute
  →
Critique
  →
Report
```

This is a conceptual scientific workflow, not a corporate business-process flowchart.

Use scientific icons and compact labels.

---

# 10. Evidence / Reproducibility

This should be one of the strongest sections.

Headline:

```text
Evidence-first scientific research
```

Show:

```text
Research Claim
      ↓
Evidence
      ↓
Source / Dataset
      ↓
Tool Execution
      ↓
Code / Parameters
      ↓
Artifact
      ↓
Reproducible Result
```

Where actually implemented, mention concepts such as:

- `EV-xxx` evidence anchors
- `EvidenceVerifier`
- `CritiqueEngine`
- PMID / NCT verification
- provenance

Do not invent additional evidence mechanisms.

---

# 11. Scientific Domains

Create a compact grid:

```text
Molecular Biology
Biomedical Research
Clinical Evidence
Drug Discovery
Computational Biology
Medical Multimodal
Scientific Data Analysis
AI for Science
```

Each card should contain:

- icon
- one-line description
- link only if a real documentation/example page exists

The purpose is to communicate breadth without creating a giant feature catalog.

---

# 12. Scientific Tools & Agent Skills

Section title:

```text
Scientific Tools & Agent Skills
```

Explain:

```text
MedScience combines Agent reasoning with executable scientific tools
and domain-specific skills.
```

Show categories such as:

```text
Literature
Biological Databases
Chemical Databases
Protein / Structure
Python
Data Analysis
Visualization
MCP
Scientific Skills
```

Use exact tool names from the repository where useful.

Do not invent APIs.

---

# 13. Quick Start

Include a compact documentation-style Quick Start.

Example only:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BenjaminDuo/MedScience.git
cd MedScience
npm install
npm run dev
```

**Verify the actual installation commands in the repository before displaying them.**

The section should guide:

```text
Install
Configure
Run
Try your first research task
```

Link to actual setup documentation when available.

---

# 14. CLI / Desktop Showcase

Use the actual repository screenshots.

The repository currently contains assets including:

```text
screenshot_desktop_dark.png
screenshot_desktop_light.png
screenshot_cli_green.png
screenshot_cli_blue.png
screenshot_cli_purple.png
screenshot_cli_amber.png
screenshot_gallery.png
screenshot_workspace_dark.png
screenshot_m2_workspace.png
```

Do not recreate these screenshots.

Create a compact section:

```text
One Scientific Agent. Multiple Interfaces.
```

Show:

- Desktop
- CLI
- Workspace

Use a clean gallery or tabs.

Do not turn the page into an image-heavy marketing page.

---

# 15. Open Source Section

Create:

```text
Open Source. Built for Researchers.
```

Suggested copy:

```text
Explore the source, extend the Agent runtime,
add scientific skills, build tools, and contribute new research workflows.
```

Buttons:

```text
GitHub
Documentation
Contributing
```

Use the real repository URL.

---

# 16. Academic Identity / Citation

Because MedScience is a scientific framework, give it an academic identity.

Use:

```text
Cite MedScience
```

If an actual paper/citation exists in the repository, use it.

If not, do not fabricate a citation.

A legitimate placeholder can be:

```text
Paper coming soon
```

only if appropriate.

---

# 17. Footer

Documentation-style footer.

### MedScience

```text
AI for Scientific Discovery
Open-source scientific Agent framework
```

### Resources

```text
Documentation
Quick Start
Examples
API Reference
Architecture
```

### Community

```text
GitHub
Issues
Discussions
Contributing
```

### Project

```text
License
Changelog
Third-party notices
```

Bottom:

```text
© MedScience
Open source under MIT License
```

Verify the actual license.

---

# 18. Theme

Implement:

```text
Light
Dark
```

Default:

```text
Light
```

Dark mode should inherit the existing MedScience desktop dark visual language:

- deep navy / black
- blue / cyan scientific accents
- restrained purple
- strong contrast

Do not create an unrelated dark theme.

Persist the preference and respect system preference when no preference is saved.

---

# 19. Responsive Design

Support:

```text
1440px
1280px
1024px
768px
390px
```

Desktop:

```text
sidebar + content
```

Mobile:

```text
collapsed sidebar
single-column content
stacked cards
vertical architecture
```

Do not merely scale down the desktop layout.

---

# 20. Accessibility

Implement:

- semantic HTML
- keyboard navigation
- visible focus states
- sufficient contrast
- alt text
- reduced-motion support
- accessible buttons
- accessible navigation

---

# 21. Technical Requirements

First inspect the existing project.

Determine whether the GitHub Pages site is:

- static HTML
- Vite
- React
- another framework

Prefer extending the existing architecture.

If the repository already contains:

```text
index.html
src/
public/
vite.config.ts
tailwind.config.js
```

do not replace the stack unnecessarily.

Avoid large dependency additions unless justified.

---

# 22. GitHub Pages

Verify:

- build command
- output directory
- base path
- static assets
- routing
- image paths
- favicon
- GitHub Actions deployment
- refresh behavior
- relative URLs

The page must work at the actual GitHub Pages URL.

Do not assume root-domain hosting.

---

# 23. SEO / Metadata

Add:

```text
<title>
<meta description>
Open Graph title
Open Graph description
Open Graph image
favicon
theme-color
```

Suggested title:

```text
MedScience — AI for Scientific Discovery
```

Suggested description:

```text
An open-source AI agent framework for scientific research, evidence-driven analysis, computational workflows, and reproducible discovery.
```

Do not make unsupported claims.

---

# 24. Visual Rules

### Sidebar

- narrow
- light
- fixed/sticky on desktop
- clear active state

### Main content

- max-width approximately 1180–1280px
- generous whitespace
- readable typography
- strong section hierarchy

### Cards

- subtle border
- very light shadow
- moderate radius
- restrained use of glassmorphism

### Typography

Prefer:

```text
Inter
system-ui
-apple-system
BlinkMacSystemFont
Segoe UI
```

### Accent palette

Primary:

```text
#2563EB
```

Secondary:

```text
#06B6D4
#7C3AED
#10B981
#F59E0B
```

Do not use every accent at maximum saturation.

---

# 25. What NOT to Do

Do NOT create:

- generic AI startup landing page
- giant neon hero
- dark-only page
- pricing table
- fake testimonials
- fake user counts
- fake GitHub stars
- fake benchmark scores
- fake scientific results
- fake paper citations
- fake integration badges
- fake “100+ tools” unless verified
- fake “autonomous discovery” claims
- stock laboratory photography
- excessive animations

The site should communicate:

> **open-source scientific infrastructure**

rather than:

> **commercial AI product**

---

# 26. Content Accuracy Rule

Before writing content, inspect:

- `README.md`
- `Agent.md`
- `Frontend_UI.md`
- source code
- `docs/`
- existing screenshots
- package metadata
- license
- GitHub repository structure

Use repository reality as the source of truth.

If a feature is:

```text
implemented → Available
partially implemented → Experimental
planned → Planned
```

Never present planned functionality as shipped.

---

# 27. OmicVerse Reference Principle

The OmicVerse homepage demonstrates a useful framework/documentation structure:

```text
Project identity
↓
Installation
↓
Tutorials
↓
API Reference
↓
Domain-specific research workflows
↓
AI / Agent interface
↓
Community / GitHub
```

MedScience should adapt that principle:

```text
Project identity
↓
Quick Start
↓
Core Concepts
↓
Scientific Agent
↓
Architecture
↓
Tools & Skills
↓
Research Workflows
↓
CLI / Desktop
↓
API / Developer Docs
↓
Community
```

The objective is for GitHub Pages to feel like a **scientific framework portal**, not a promotional microsite.
