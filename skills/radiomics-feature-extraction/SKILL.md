# Medical Imaging Radiomics & Texture Feature Extraction

## Overview
Wraps `medical_imaging_process` into a standardized radiomics analysis SOP, extracting high-throughput quantitative imaging phenotypes across 3 core feature families:
1. **First-Order Intensity Statistics**: Mean, Median, Variance, Skewness, Kurtosis, and Energy within physical CT bounds ($HU \in [-1024, +3071]$).
2. **Morphological Shape Descriptors**: Volume ($\text{mm}^3$), Surface Area, Sphericity, and Surface-to-Volume ratio.
3. **Second-Order Texture Features**: Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) Contrast, Dissimilarity, Homogeneity, ASM, Energy, and Correlation.
