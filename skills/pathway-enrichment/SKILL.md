# Pathway Enrichment & Cascade Analysis

## Overview
Maps candidate or differentially expressed genes against annotated pathway databases (Reactome, KEGG, GO) and performs overrepresentation testing via hypergeometric distribution ($p = \sum_{i=k}^n \frac{\binom{M}{i}\binom{N-M}{n-i}}{\binom{N}{n}}$) with Benjamini-Hochberg FDR q-value correction.
