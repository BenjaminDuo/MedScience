# PRISMA 2020 Systematic Review Workflow & Flowchart Generator

## Overview
Implements the 4-phase PRISMA 2020 (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) workflow:
1. **Identification**: Records identified from PubMed, Europe PMC, arXiv/bioRxiv, ClinicalTrials.gov, and registries.
2. **Deduplication**: Automated exact DOI / title duplicate filtering.
3. **Screening**: Title and abstract screening with recorded reason counts.
4. **Included**: Full-text assessed for eligibility and final studies included in quantitative/qualitative synthesis.
